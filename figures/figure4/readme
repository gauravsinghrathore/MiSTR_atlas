## Bulk RNA-seq and ATAC-seq analysis

This folder contains notebooks used for analysis of bulk RNA-seq and bulk ATAC-seq data associated with Figure 3G and Figure 4.

## Preprocessing

Sequence alignment and initial preprocessing were performed using the nf-core pipeline:

## Downstream analysis

Downstream analyses include:

- Gene expression analysis using DESeq2 (R)  
- Locus accessibility timeline analysis  
- Visualization using matplotlib (Python)  

Users may set up a conda environment that supports both R and Python to run the notebooks seamlessly.

## Track visualization

Genome browser tracks were generated using the pyBigWig Python library.

Tracks can be visualized using IGV:

## Notes

These notebooks reflect the analysis performed for the manuscript. File paths and compute settings may need to be adjusted depending on the local environment.
