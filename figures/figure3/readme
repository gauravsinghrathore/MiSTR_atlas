## Figure 3 – Pseudotime Analysis of Rostro-Caudal Patterning

This folder contains the notebook used to generate analyses for **Figure 3**.

### Notebook
**`mistr_pseudotime_RC.ipynb`**

This notebook includes code to:

- Identify and subset **OTX2⁺ (rostral)** and **GBX2⁺ (caudal)** cell populations from **day 0–9 MiSTR tissues**
- Perform pseudotime analysis on each subset to investigate early rostro-caudal patterning dynamics

## Environment Setup

We recommend creating a **Conda environment** with both **Python and R** installed to ensure compatibility with the analysis workflow.

Official Conda environment management instructions:

## Optional Tools

For an improved development experience, editors such as **Visual Studio Code** with AI-assisted coding extensions (e.g., GitHub Copilot) may help streamline environment setup and notebook execution. These tools are optional and not required to run the analysis.
