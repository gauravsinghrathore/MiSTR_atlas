## This folder consists notebooks for figure 2: Mapping regional and temporal expression dynamics in MiSTR models
These notebooks address code used to map

1. Human brain develpment atlas Braun et al 2023 onto MiSTR dataset (both spatial and single cell transcriptomics)
2. Mouse grasturaltion atals on MiSTR day 0-5 cells.
3. MiSTR data on CS9 neural only human enbryo from Yuan et al 2025


In detail :

Notebook Title : MiSTR_d14_d21_bonefight_spatial_mappping.ipynb
This notebook overlays day 14 and 21 MiSTR data on spatail dataset of week 5 PC from braun et al
tools used Scanpy Tangram and Bonefight 
Tangram can be downlaod and installed fom here

Notebook Title : mistr_pred_with_hbd_merged_tissue.ipynb

This notebook represents label transfers (Forebrain , Midbrain amd Hindbrain ) from first trimester developing brain Braun et al to day 9-62 MiSTR tissues

The data was acquied from Linnarsson Lab Github repo 
Paper : https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adf1226

Repo : https://github.com/linnarsson-lab/developing-human-brain

to reuse the dataset either download the h5ad file provided or follow this issue 
https://github.com/linnarsson-lab/developing-human-brain/issues/3

System requirements computer with RAM more than 300 GB, GPU (16 - 24 GB), multicore processor 32 cores minimum recommended. 

for label transfer SCVI Tools was used 
Installation instructions can be found on SCVI API: https://scvi-tools.org/
this requires a GPU to run efficiently. 


Notebook Title : mouse_gastrulation_mistr_early_patterning.ipynb
