## This folder consists notebooks for figure 2: Mapping regional and temporal expression dynamics in MiSTR models
These notebooks address code used to map

1. Human brain develpment atlas Braun et al 2023 onto MiSTR dataset (both spatial and single cell transcriptomics)
2. Mouse grasturaltion atals on MiSTR day 0-5 cells.
3. MiSTR data on CS9 neural only human enbryo from Yuan et al 2025
