## Figure 4 analysis (scRNA-seq, D–V forebrain)

This folder contains the notebook used to analyse and generate Figure 4, showing scRNA-seq analysis of cells from dorso–ventral forebrain MiSTR tissue.

Analysis was performed using Scanpy (Python) and integration was done using fastMNN (R, batchelor package).

To run the notebook, both Python and R are required in the same conda environment. Communication between Python and R is handled using rpy2 or notebook magics.

## Installation

Create environment:
conda create -n your_env python=3.10  
conda activate your_env

Install Python packages:
pip install scanpy anndata numpy pandas matplotlib rpy2  

Install R:
conda install -c conda-forge r-base r-essentials  

Open R and install fastMNN dependencies:
install.packages("BiocManager")  
BiocManager::install("batchelor")  
BiocManager::install("SingleCellExperiment")  

## Notes

fastMNN requires R and is not available in Python.  
Cell execution depends on proper Python–R interaction via rpy2.  
Paths and environment setup may need adjustment depending on the system and operating systems.
