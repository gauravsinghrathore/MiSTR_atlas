Advanced stem cell models can provide insights into early human brain development at embryonic stages which are normally inaccessible. We have previously developed the Microfluidic Stem Cell Regionalisation (MiSTR) model, which recapitulates the rostro-caudal patterning of the developing human neural tube through a WNT activation (WNTa) gradient. Here, we complement the original MiSTR rostro-caudal model with a novel dorso-ventral model of the forebrain and performed single cell transcriptomics to capture the development of dorsal and ventral neural tube populations across 9 timepoints. From this, we created a trajectory map of early neural tube patterning, showing that rostral and caudal subtypes were specified already at 24 hours after initiation of the WNTa gradient,  several days before the onset of neuralisation. Surprisingly, neuralisation occured through divergent transcriptional programs in the rostral (PAX6+) versus caudal (SOX1+) domains. In contrast to the extremely early specification of the rostro-caudal axis, response to ventralising signals in the telencephalic domain was developmentally delayed and did not occur until day 9. Our model further uncovered the temporal events involved in human midbrain-hindbrain boundary formation and ventral forebrain patterning, contributing to our knowledge on the early establishment of region-specific neural fates. ![Uploading image.pngâ€¦]()
