Mapping early patterning events in human neural development using an in-vitro microfluidic stem cell model

Stem cell models can provide insights into human brain development at embryonic stages which are normally inaccessible. We previously developed the Microfluidic Stem Cell Regionalisation (MiSTR) model, which recapitulates the rostro-caudal patterning of human neural tube through a WNT activation (WNTa) gradient. Through temporal single cell transcriptomics of rostro-caudal and dorso-ventral gradient-patterned MiSTR, we found that rostro-caudal subtypes were regionally specified and fate-determined already during the late epiblast stage, several days before onset of neuralisation at day 3-4. Rostral cells were characterised by expression of HESX1 and SHISA2 during pre-neuralisation and PAX6 during early neuralisation, whereas caudal cells expressed FST and HOXA1 during pre-neuralisation and SOX1 as the dominant neuralising factor. In contrast to the early rostro-caudal specification, response to ventralisation in telencephalic progenitors was developmentally delayed and occurred around day 9. We further uncovered temporal events in human midbrain-hindbrain boundary formation and ventral forebrain patterning, contributing new knowledge on early human neural region-specification.
