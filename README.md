Mapping early patterning events in human neural development using an in vitro microfluidic stem cell model

## Abstract  
Stem cell models can provide insights into human brain development at embryonic stages which are normally inaccessible. We applied a previously developed Microfluidic Stem Cell Regionalisation (MiSTR) model to recapitulate rostro-caudal patterning of the human neural tube through a WNT activation (WNTa) gradient. Single cell transcriptomics of rostro-caudal and dorso-ventral gradient-patterned MiSTR, showed that rostro-caudal subtypes of the forebrain and hindbrain were regionally specified and fate-determined already during the late epiblast stage, several days before onset of neuralisation. Rostral cells were characterised by expression of HESX1 and SHISA2 during pre-neuralisation and PAX6 during early neuralisation, whereas caudal cells expressed FST and HOXA1 during pre-neuralisation and SOX1 as the dominant neuralising factor. In contrast to the early rostro-caudal specification, response to ventralisation in telencephalic progenitors was developmentally delayed and occurred around day 9. We further uncovered temporal events in human midbrain-hindbrain boundary formation and ventral forebrain patterning, contributing new knowledge on early human neural region-specification.
